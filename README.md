# SeamCarver

Seam Carving is an innovative image resizing technique that preserves important features within an image while resizing it. This project implements the Seam Carving algorithm, a technique that intelligently removes vertical or horizontal seams from an image to resize it while retaining its essential content.

Overview

Seam Carving is a content-aware resizing technique that intelligently removes pixels along the least significant paths in an image. These paths, called seams, are determined by calculating the energy of each pixel, which quantifies its importance based on color gradients. The lower the energy, the more suitable the pixel is for removal.

The core aspects of this project include:

Energy Calculation: An energy function is applied to each pixel, which captures its importance based on color gradients. The energy of a pixel is calculated as the sum of squared gradients in both the x and y directions.
Seam Identification: By considering the energy of pixels, the algorithm identifies the seam with the minimum total energy, i.e., the path of least importance pixels from the top to the bottom (or left to right) of the image.
Seam Removal: Once the seam is identified, the pixels along the seam are removed, effectively reducing the size of the image while retaining its important content.
Implementation

The project provides a SeamCarver class with the following methods:

public SeamCarver(Picture picture): Initializes a SeamCarver object based on the given picture.
public Picture picture(): Retrieves the current picture.
public int width(): Returns the width of the current picture.
public int height(): Returns the height of the current picture.
public double energy(int x, int y): Computes the energy of the pixel at the given column x and row y.
public int[] findHorizontalSeam(): Finds the sequence of indices for a horizontal seam.
public int[] findVerticalSeam(): Finds the sequence of indices for a vertical seam.
public void removeHorizontalSeam(int[] seam): Removes a horizontal seam from the current picture.
public void removeVerticalSeam(int[] seam): Removes a vertical seam from the current picture.
Getting Started

Import the provided SeamCarver class.
Create a SeamCarver object by passing a Picture object representing the image.
Use the various methods to calculate energy, find seams, and remove seams.
Usage

The Seam Carving technique is a powerful tool for image resizing while maintaining essential visual elements. By implementing the Seam Carver, you'll have the ability to intelligently resize images, ensuring that key features are retained even during significant size adjustments.
